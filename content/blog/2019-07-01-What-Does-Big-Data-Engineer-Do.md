Big data engineer or data engineer becomes more and more important role in big data orgnization. This role is quite like the ETL developer role in the data warehouse or database developer role in database development. However, it more focus on the senario in *Applied Big Data*. Here *Applied* means how to make big data applied in the business use case. As explained, it has to master the data and also make it useful. It is more like a "Full Stack Developer" in big data.
